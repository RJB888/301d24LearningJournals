#Learning Journal Day 18

Today felt slower.  We came into it pretty much at MVP and spent the entire day trying to make everything look nice, which was a struggle since none of us have an eye for design... We ended up getting Shayne to come in and look at our stuff, and when he saw our "page" he looked at us like we were crazy because there was NO design to the page.... Anyway, he gave us some pointers and we ran with it.  Now its looking better, but it's not done yet.  And we are still re-factoring into MVC structure, trying to decide what belongs in the model, and what is a controller.
