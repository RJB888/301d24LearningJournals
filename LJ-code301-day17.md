# Learning Journal Day 17

Today went better.  Got some things done working on the HTML and CSS  for the basic styling of the app.  The test review was vindicating.  It was good to see Nick appalled at the format of the questions.  Hopefully it saved some people from not making it to 401 due to the crappy test.  I think we will make MVP early tomorrow, which gives us time to beautify it (which it desperately needs).  At least I'm not swamped with homework this week, and I have some time to relax.
