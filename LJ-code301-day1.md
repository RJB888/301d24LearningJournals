#Learning Journal Day 1

Today was too strange.  It felt like we didn't cover much, but that we were expected learn more from the reading and online research than we got from the class.  I hope that isn't the way things are going to go from here.  I understand being expected to be able to learn from documentation, but if we are expected to self teach this stuff, why are we in class.  I guess it just felt "under-explained" in class, then I started doing the reading and it went into more detail, and the code wars assignment dealt with regex, which we haven't even covered.  I don't know if we were expected to ditch the regex and use other means to figure out the answer, but I ended up researching regex and doing it that way.  I also felt the "guidelines" for the personal page were super vague.  I'm not sure if thats on purpose, or what, but I kinda had no idea where to start with that one.  We are kind of expected to just be able to come up with designs on our own, but some of us aren't good at that... anyway I guess I'm just venting.... I just worry that I will have problems with assignments because the instructions were vague, or like last class, because I submitted the wrong link because I didn't understand what was expected of me.  I'm also having a little trouble with the new system of having 2 separate repositories for labs, and classwork.. not sure how to structure my repositories for 301, if they should be all new from 201, or continue (in the case of Learning Journals).  
Now I am a little worried about getting the initial portfolio thing done, but the idea I had seems like its going to be hard to get an initial setup done in time... and I don't want to get behind...... anyway...
