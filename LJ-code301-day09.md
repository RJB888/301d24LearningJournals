#Learning Journal Day09

Today went a little better.  The extra lecture time was helpful, although going back and forth from the back-end to the front-end tied me in knots a bit.  Some of us stayed after hours and put the grocery store demo on the projector and walked through the code, helping each other figure out exactly what was happening.  That helped quite a bit, and I was able to walk through the code and understand what it was doing.  I still feel like I would have trouble trying to duplicate it on my own, I would have to lean heavily on some other code in order to remember to include everything that needs to be in there.
