#Learning Journal Day 07

Today.  Well, it started bad from the beginning.  Bad traffic, missed the bus, etc etc.  The lecture.. too much of here's this thing, but I'll explain it later. Have no idea what the heck is really happening with the server stuff.  I can follow along like a trained monkey, but I would rather understand what these things are doing.  Then the paired programming thing, where I pretty much just told my partner fine, we'll just do what you want.... then walking 3/4 of a mile in pouring rain to get to the bus stop since traffic was in gridlock, only to barely catch the bus, and its full.. .so I had to stand for the entire ride home.  Then I sat at home trying to do the code wars assignment, which for some reason I couldn't think through, or make my logic work, so I paired up with my wife, and finally at 12:30 I had the jankiest crappy code that finally passed all the tests.  And I saw the "solutions" which were way more elegant than mine, and even followed the logic I had wanted to use from the beginning, but didn't have any idea how to properly implement.  So, you can take day 7, shred it.. burn it and bury it in the back yard.  So, now I have to do the reading for today (for what its worth), and try to implement the server code crap into my portfolio. Yay.
