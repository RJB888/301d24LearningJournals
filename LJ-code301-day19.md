# Learning Journal Day 19

Almost there.  Its been an odd one this time, going from 201 where I felt I had a good grasp of the concepts, to now where I feel like I am barely keeping my head above water.  Project is mostly done, might be a few last tweaks to it tonight, but we should be ready to present tomorrow.  I feel like we created a solid app.  Eager to see what the other groups have done.
