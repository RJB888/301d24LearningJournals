#Learning Journal Day 08

I feel more and more like I am slipping into the abyss. Although I can do the work, and get the grades, I don't feel like I am grasping it enough to be able to use it on my own, or use it in any other context than copy and paste it from the code demo.  I really don't like that feeling.  At least in 201 we were coding from scratch almost every day, so I felt I could make it my own.  This stuff, if I don't use it in exactly the same context as we did in class, I have no idea what I'm doing.... Yeah, I know... "trust the process.."  It's a little hard to do when my livelihood will depend on whether or not I can convince a potential employer that I am capable of doing the work, which is hard to do when I don't feel like I can.  
The portfolio is a lost cause.  I feel like its not "mine" because we are forced to use different tools in it, in order to reinforce the class learning, and therefore, I can't make it the way I want it because that wouldn't include the necessary things to pass the course.  Given this circumstance, I have little drive to make it nice and professional... which is a shame, because I really should be using it as a way to practice.
