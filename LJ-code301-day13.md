#Learning Journal Day 13

Today's Heroku deployment went fairly well.  Once we sorted out what the instructions were, it was fairly easy to implement.  I'm still playing catch-up with assignments, but I feel like I'm walking up the "down" escalator.... I just don't seem to make any headway.  I'm sure eventually I will be able to catch up... when no new assignments are being given.

OH... and in case Nick is still reading these..  <sarcasm>It would be great if we could implement some sort of respectful method of taking turns to talk in class, instead of just blurting out whatever pops into your head, no matter if someone else is trying to get a question asked, or figure something out.  I mean, we all really want to know if "thats not how you did it" or "i don't get it" </sarcasm> but some other people need a chance to be heard, and its frustrating to sit with your hand up trying to be nice and take your turn when someone else just thinks they can interject themselves into the lecture whenever it strikes their fancy.
