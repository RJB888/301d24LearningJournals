#Learning Journal Day 15

Working on the Pokedex was a very good exercise.  It helped to follow through the mental process of writing an app, or at least how Nick writes an app.  I saw how we started with a basic idea and created that functionality, and then as we went we decided on more functionality or changes to the existing functionality and implemented those as we went.  We focused on one piece at a time and didn't get overwhelmed with the project as a whole.  Overall a good experience.

Going to be in over the weekend trying to catch up on the portfolio assignments, do some research on our project, and maybe start in on the 401 prework.  #codefellowslife
