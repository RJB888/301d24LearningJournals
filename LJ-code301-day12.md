#Learning Journal Day 12

I'm still too far behind.  I ended up turning in the portfolio assignment for day 11 using day 10's pull request just to get something turned in on time... because I didn't have time to even touch it.
Went to the Operation Code meetup tonight... the speakers were good, I was hoping to get some leads with the people at Axon who hosted it, but the hiring guy who was there seemed seriously disinterested in the Code Fellows people... so I don't know if it worth pursuing that one.
