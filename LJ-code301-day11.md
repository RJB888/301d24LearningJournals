#Learning Journal Day 11

Here we go again.. Day 11.  Lets see.  Day 11 seemed ... better than day 10.  I felt a little like I understood what the pageJS stuff was supposed to do, but again, when it came to the lab I was unable to put it into use.  I understood the basic idea of putting page('route', callback) for each route, and then calling page() at the end, but trying to put that into the kilovolt blog code base was hard, mostly because the instructions were pretty vague on what was desired.  So I will again be waiting for the code demo to walk me through what it was supposed to do.  Pretty frustrating.  I seem to be having the most trouble with the actual link between front end and back end. I need an "a-ha!" moment on this.  I am also struggling a bit with actual understanding of what an API <em><b>is</b></em>.  Every time I have "seen" an API (or what I think is an API) it just looks like a JSON object of data.  But I tried to watch some videos last night on it, and the videos were saying that the API is the software (middleware?) that provides the actual data transfer from server to front end user.  SO... when we are looking at an "API" (by which I mean looking at a web address that says "API" that looks like a huge JSON object) are we looking at the output of the API that is on that company's server? or is the JSON objec the API ?
