# Learning Journal Day 20

Captain's Log:

We have reached the end of our 20 day journey through the treacherous land of Code 301.  It has been a long and arduous trek, and though we didn't lose anyone, the entire crew is battered and exhausted.  Some of the crew are still confused as to what the purpose of that mission was.  All I can tell them, is that we made it, and to take some well deserved shore leave before we warp to the Python Zone for a 10 week "study and observation" mission.  I hope we are better able to navigate the trials and traps that are assuredly laid for us by the sadistic Pythonistas.  My ultimate goal will be to learn as much of their technology as I can, and of course... to make it out alive.

END.  SAVE-LOG.  SIGN-OFF "CAPTAIN".



Goodbye 301.  It was...hard, frustrating, emotional, and educational.
