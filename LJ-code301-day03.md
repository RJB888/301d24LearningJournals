#Learning Journal Day 3

Finally felt like I got some work done today.  But that is because I stayed here until 10pm working on it..... It works so much better to have time after the lecture to work on things.  It would be so much better if we had morning lecture and had the afternoon to work.  I finally feel like I'm "on my feet" as far as the portfolio goes, although its still way off from being a professional looking site.
