# Learnin Journal Day 16

Today was a little frustrating, in that I felt pretty useless to my team.  In my 201 project I was able to understand what JS needed to be written and hammer it out rapidly.  With this one, I am so lost on the server.js stuff and the APIs that I feel like I am a burden to my team.  I am hoping to get my shit together and be more productive tomorrow.  We shall see.
