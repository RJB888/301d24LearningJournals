#Learning Journal Day 14

Today it was good to go through the lecture and build something from scratch and see how the process is very much a try and see kind of thing.  I felt like I knew most of the basics to get it off the ground, and its a testing matter to get everything working.  So, that was good.  I still am procrastinating on my portfolio assignments, I'd rather help someone else debug theirs than work on mine... I'm not sure why that is.  I have to buckle down and get some re-submissions turned in...before projects start.
