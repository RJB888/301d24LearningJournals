#Learning Journal Day 4

Well, I finally turned in a portfolio assignment ahead of time, because it met the technical goals, and did what it was supposed to... but I only got 1 more point for it than the one I turned in that was broke as hell... kind of disheartening that the little nit-picky things are given so much weight.  Its frustrating to get something "done" and get basically the same points as the broke stuff.  oh well.

 Had fun with the paired programming today, it went well, and our little group of students was able to figure it out without having to access the TAs.  I feel like that is a good thing.  I'm glad we are able to work together and help each other out.

I feel like we are getting more out of the lectures and code reviews now that everyone seems more comfortable being candid about when they don't get something and asking questions.  I am learning a lot more I think, than I would otherwise.
