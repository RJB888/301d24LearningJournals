#Learning Journal Day 10

FUCK!  I keep forgetting to get these in on time. Even if I'm not getting the points, I'm writing it anyway.... So, we are behind on the projects.  Not sure how we are going to get the paired portfolio work done over the weekend, which basically makes it so we have 2 labs to do on monday morning...  I am worried that I am not putting in enough time, practicing coding, etc to be "ready" by the end of 401.  I have seen what other people are doing and I feel behind, even though I am keeping up with the work and my grades.  I don't know if there's more I should be doing or not.   I keep being told to "trust the process" but, should I?  Should I trust that if I do only what is given as assignments that I will be "employable" by the end?  I don't even know where to look to do the "extra" work, other than doing more code wars challenges.  I'm freaking out.
