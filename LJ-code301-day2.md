#Learning Journal Day 2

I am starting to think the flow of the day is partially responsible for throwing me off my game.  Am totally not used to having time in the morning to do stuff, and no time in the afternoon.  By the time I got "spooled up" to do work this afternoon it was time to pack up and catch the last bus home... Partially due to getting help from Nick and one of the TA's about yesterday's work, but still, I am used to having more time in the afternoon to get work done, now I have to do some, pack up, get home, break it all out again and try to pick up where I left off.  I hope I don't have to start trying to drive in so that I can stay past when the last bus leaves.  Otherwise, I may have to try doing the paired programming in the afternoons and getting my lab work done in the morning... but I'm sure we will quickly come to a point where we won't be able to get the paired programming piece done in the last 2 hours of the day.
Nick was a big help today sorting out how to get the layout for my profile page to become a reality.  I am starting to feel like I am slipping behind (already) and that I don't have enough time to do the things well.  I feel like I will be able to barely scrape by and meet the requirements to pass the class, but it doesn't seem like I will have as thorough understanding as I would like to have.  I feel like I am following along in the class code demos, but when it's time to implement it, I almost feel like I have to re-learn it because I can't apply it to my own work.  Not sure what that's all about.  Still seems like the instructions are vague, or maybe they were written for a class that was taught a little differently?  Or maybe there's some nomenclature there I just don't have a grasp of like "source data" I am assuming that is meant to be the info for our portfolio like the links to projects, or work history info, and a better understanding of what base, layout, and module css things are.  I still don't feel like I have a grasp of that part of it either.  Not sure if I need to do more reading or what.  I just don't feel like I have the time, or that these ideas are too abstract or relative to be able to learn, because they mean something different to each person.  I just feel, overall, like I don't know stuff that we are "supposed" to know.
